            moved setpoint decoupler cap to hopefully lower interferance with
            relatively high frequency output from the comparitors
            
            connector positioning for plugboard complete
            
            moved sense connector to allow better placement of corresponding
            socket on plugboards (sense traces needed more room on plugboards)

            added ground strap points to plugboards, and positioned them to
            align with the ground strap on the main board
            
            displaywriter plugboard completely wired
            
            added cutouts in plugboards for expasion header wiring
        todo:
            maybe add more grounding straps to aid in mechanical strength
            (i intend to use metal standoffs to connect the plugboards and 
            main board)

            removed capacitor on DAC output.

            Cleanup of project structure
            Removed pull-ups from lm339 outputs. The atmega can supply internal pull-ups.
            Fixed missing connection to ground strap on main board
            Remove second set of biasing resistors (better for >4row keyboards)
            Made all resistors horizontally soldered
            Added option to use individual resistors instead of resistor networks. (Easier to source)
            Added pads to more easily short reset and GND.
            Use net tie to enforce star ground
            Thicken up ground traces
            Beamspring: Use new improved footprint
            Beamspring: added mounting hole
            Displaywriter: don't interfere with mounting plate, Add support for various vertical pin pitches, and for original connector.
            Displaywriter: Added support for using the mounting plate but only when using the original connector.
            Added Beamship plugboard to a separate subfolder. Not added to the default panel because it's too rare.
            Bumped revision to 0.0.3
            Added revision to silkscreen.
